### üêç Automated Snake Game ‚Äî Powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning

This project showcases an automated Snake game where a learning agent is trained using **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** to play the game effectively without losing. The agent learns through trial and error, improving its strategy over time.

The game is built using **Python**, with key libraries including:

* `torch` for neural network modeling
* `pygame` for game simulation
* `numpy`, `random`, and `collections` for logic and environment setup
* `matplotlib` and `IPython` for visualizations and interactive output
* `os` for system operations

The result is a fully self-playing Snake game where the AI adapts to maximize survival and score
